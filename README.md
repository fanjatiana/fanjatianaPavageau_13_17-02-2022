This repo contains all the source code of the Argent Bank application.

To use the Argent Bank application you must install and launch the micro API and have installed Create React App.


## 1. Installing the micro API (without docker)

### 1.1 Prerequisites

Argent Bank uses the following tech stack:

- [Node.js v12](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Please make sure you have the right versions and download both packages. You can verify this by using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check Mongo version
mongo --version
```

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install nvm. This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

### 1.2 Launching the API

- The npm install command will allow you to install the dependencies.
